# Wind Turbine Failure Prediction using Neural Networks â€“ ReneWind Project

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to build and tune neural network classification models to predict **failures in wind turbines**. Early detection of failures can reduce maintenance costs by enabling timely **repairs** and avoiding **replacements**.

### Nature of Predictions:

- **True Positives (TP)**: Actual failures correctly predicted â€“ **Repair Cost**
- **False Negatives (FN)**: Failures missed by model â€“ **Replacement Cost**
- **False Positives (FP)**: Incorrect failure predictions â€“ **Inspection Cost**

**Cost Hierarchy:**  
*Inspection Cost* < ðŸ”§ *Repair Cost* < ðŸ’£ *Replacement Cost*

## Data Dictionary

- **Predictors**: 40 continuous sensor features (not named explicitly)
- **Target Variable**:
  - `1` â€“ Failure occurred
  - `0` â€“ No failure

Data is split into **train.csv** and **test.csv**.

## Actionable Insights

- Gradual tuning (increasing epochs before batch size) helped smoothen metric curves.
- Adam Optimizer performed better than SGD and Adagrad, especially with a low learning rate.
- Techniques like **Dropout**, **Batch Normalization**, and **Regularization** effectively reduced overfitting.
- Weight initialization impacted convergence and final metrics.

## Business Recommendations

- Focus on monitoring the following **key sensor features**: `V7`, `V11`, `V15`, `V16`, `V21`, `V28`, `V34`
- Improving accuracy in detecting failures through these features can reduce high replacement costs.
- Prioritize **preventive maintenance** over post-failure replacement by implementing real-time monitoring based on this model.
- Use model output as a **risk classification tool** for scheduling inspections efficiently.
